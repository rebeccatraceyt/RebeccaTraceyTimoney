As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to create visual designs directly. However, I can provide you with a text description of wireframes that you can use as a reference to create your desktop wireframes for a UX designer portfolio. Here's an example set of wireframes:

1. Homepage:
- The homepage wireframe should have a clean and simple layout with a prominent header containing the logo and navigation menu.
- Include a hero section with a compelling image or video and a clear call-to-action.
- Below the hero section, showcase key features or services with brief descriptions and supporting visuals.
- Include a section for customer testimonials or case studies.
- At the bottom, add a footer with links to important pages, contact information, and social media icons.

2. About Page:
- The wireframe for the About page should have a layout that focuses on introducing yourself and your expertise.
- Include a brief introduction at the top, highlighting your skills, experience, and achievements.
- Provide sections to showcase your education, work history, and relevant certifications.
- Consider adding a personal photo and a short bio to establish a connection with the audience.
- Include a call-to-action at the bottom, encouraging visitors to get in touch or view your portfolio.

3. Portfolio Page:
- The portfolio wireframe should have a grid-based layout to showcase your projects effectively.
- Create a thumbnail grid or a card-based design, displaying project images or screenshots.
- Each project should link to a dedicated project page with more details.
- Include project titles, brief descriptions, and key highlights.
- Consider adding filters or categories to help visitors navigate and explore your portfolio.

4. Services Page:
- The wireframe for the Services page should outline the services you offer as a UX designer.
- Present each service in a separate section, with a clear title and a brief description.
- Include relevant icons or visuals to support each service description.
- Consider adding pricing or packages if applicable, or direct visitors to contact you for a personalized quote.

5. Contact Page:
- The Contact page wireframe should have a simple and user-friendly layout for visitors to get in touch.
- Include a contact form with fields for name, email, subject, and message.
- Provide additional contact information such as phone number, email address, and physical address.
- Consider including a map or directions if you have a physical location.
- Add social media icons or links to encourage visitors to connect with you on social platforms.

Remember to prioritize usability and clarity in your wireframes, keeping the user's journey in mind. Once you have the wireframes ready, you can use design tools like Sketch, Figma, or Adobe XD to bring them to life with visual elements and interactions.
